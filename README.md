## Sentry
**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.**
For more details and for information on how to disable the error reporting, see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Info
This adapter can be used to poll information from devices like printers, network devices, etc. using SNMP protocol.

## Adapter-Configuration
The adapter queries specified OIDs, which are grouped within oid groups which in turn are assigned to devices.
The configuration data is entered at several tabs. The adapter supports IPv4 and IPv6 connections.

For details see the documentation referenced below.

   ### **WORK IN PROGRESS**

### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
- (bluefox) The option "do not close session on error" is documented, and the option table uses the labels of the dialog, so that every option can be found under the name it has there (#288)
- (bluefox) A device using SNMP v3 whose authorization id is empty or refers to nothing is skipped with a warning instead of asking without a user name - such a request is answered with "Unknown User Name", which named neither the device nor the missing authorization set (#409). The ids of device and authorization set are compared without leading and trailing blanks now
- (bluefox) The states use the roles of the ioBroker role list: a number is `value` resp. `level` when it is writeable, a boolean `indicator` resp. `switch`, a text `text`, and the type states no longer use the role `type.encoding`, which does not exist. The error flag of a device is `indicator.error` instead of `indicator.reachable` (#524)
- (bluefox) New value format "hex dump": binary data of an OctetString, Opaque or Counter64 is stored as "76 01 04 00 27 10", the way a MIB browser shows it, and a writeable OID takes that notation back (#623)
- (bluefox) New tab "MIB": MIB files can be uploaded and browsed, and a device can be read live - the browser fills the OID group of the selected device, one OID at a time or all shown at once
- (bluefox) An incomplete configuration no longer disables the instance: a device without OIDs is skipped with a warning, so that a new device can be set up with the MIB browser while the adapter is running
- (bluefox) The screenshots of the documentation have been renewed and show the current dialog, including the MIB tab
- (bluefox) The options of the config dialog use the width of the dialog again - on a wide screen their labels were squeezed into a narrow column
- (bluefox) The documentation has been brought up to date: the format of an OID and the state type it produces, the objects and states the adapter creates with their roles and quality codes, writing back to a device, the three options which were missing, and the MIB tab plus the setup wizard in the russian documentation
- (bluefox) A folder of the MIB browser can be taken over as a whole: its plus button adds every value below it to the OID group, read in one walk
- (bluefox) The MIB browser has one source now: it reads the device live, level by level, and names what comes back with the uploaded MIB files - the separate, offline tree of a MIB file is gone, the module list jumps to the beginning of a MIB instead
- (bluefox) Fixed: with SNMP v1 the end of a subtree is reported as the error NoSuchName, which made every level of a v1 device fail
- (bluefox) Fixed: the live view skipped every second row of a table - the rows carry their value at the oid of the row itself, so the jump behind a row has to start below it, not at the next row
- (bluefox) An OID taken over from a MIB file now addresses a value: a scalar is stored as "<OID>.0" (the ".0" stays out of the object id), a column of a table is marked, because it needs the index of a row - which the live read of the device delivers
- (bluefox) New setup wizard on the "Devices" tab: it asks for the device, lets you upload its MIB files and pick the values to read - including a live read of the device before it has ever been saved
- (bluefox) The devices are configured first: the tab "Devices" comes before "OID sets", the device table is no longer hidden until an OID group exists, and an empty OID table no longer blocks the save button
- (bluefox) New option "use MIB names": the OID field then also accepts symbolic names like IF-MIB::ifDescr.1 and the object ids are built from the MIB symbol. Attention: switching this option changes the object ids of existing OIDs
- (bluefox) The adapter has been refactored to TypeScript, the sources now live in `src/` and are compiled to `build/`
- (bluefox) The admin translations have been moved from `admin/i18n/<lang>/translations.json` to `admin/i18n/<lang>.json`, `admin/words.js` has been removed
- (bluefox) The npm `install` script has been removed - the configuration migration runs at adapter startup as before
- (bluefox) The adapter can no longer be installed directly from GitHub (`common.nogit`), please install it from npm
- (copilot) Adapter requires node.js >= 22 now
- (copilot) Adapter requires admin >= 7.7.22 now
